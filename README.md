## How to run it
To see actual demo, visit the site or follow these steps below...

### For you to check out yourself
Download the Zip File or Clone this repository (Star/fork to show support! :D)

``` 
  In node.js's command prompt, you MUST be in the root directory of the repository you downloaded,
  So make sure you are in it using the 'cd' command to traverse through your directories
```

Next after you are in the root directory, install the necessary packages in node.js's command prompt. Type out `npm install` and then press Enter. All the package information necessary are in the package.json file so you do NOT need to find out what packages my project uses.


After package installation make sure you have Mongo installed and have a database set up in C:// or whatever yours is. Make sure your server DB is running by using `mongod` command or running mongod.exe manually.
Be sure to actually know how MongoDB works (watch a tutorial video if you don't!).

Then in node.js's command prompt write out `node app.js` and it should successfully run.


Server is ran @ localhost:3000, so check in your browser to see if it runs.
Feel free to do whatever you like to it. Have fun, I made this to learn how to use some tools. :P
